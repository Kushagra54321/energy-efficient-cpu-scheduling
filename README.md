Energy-Efficient-CPU-Scheduling
 Introduction
This project implements an **Energy Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm** that optimizes task execution based on **power consumption** and **priority levels**. The algorithm ensures minimal energy usage while maintaining efficient CPU performance.

 Features
- **Power-efficient scheduling** to reduce energy consumption
- **Priority-based execution** for optimized task management
- **Fast and efficient process execution**
- **Dynamic process handling** with adaptable scheduling

 Installation & Usage
 **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x installed

 **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

 **Run the Scheduler**
```sh
python scheduler.py
```

 Algorithm Workflow
1. **Processes are sorted** based on priority first, then power efficiency.
2. **CPU schedules execution** in an optimized order.
3. **Execution time and power consumption** are displayed.
4. **Efficient resource utilization** ensures minimal energy waste.
